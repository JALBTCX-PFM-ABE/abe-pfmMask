/****************************************  IMPORTANT NOTE  **********************************

    Comments in this file that start with / * ! or / / ! are being used by Doxygen to
    document the software.  Dashes in these comment blocks are used to create bullet lists.
    The lack of blank lines after a block of dash preceeded comments means that the next
    block of dash preceeded comments is a new, indented bullet list.  I've tried to keep the
    Doxygen formatting to a minimum but there are some other items (like <br> and <pre>)
    that need to be left alone.  If you see a comment that starts with / * ! or / / ! and
    there is something that looks a bit weird it is probably due to some arcane Doxygen
    syntax.  Be very careful modifying blocks of Doxygen comments.

    First working version.


    Version 1.01
    Jan C. Depner
    01/07/10

    Force the average filtered surface to the mask value if this was a MISP or GMT surface (because the PFM library
    won't recompute it if it's not named AVERAGE FILTERED SURFACE or AVERAGE EDITED SURFACE).


    Version 1.02
    Jan C. Depner
    01/19/10

    Southern hemisphere bug fix with the mask.  Also, added capability to use SRTM topo data instead of mask
    value.


    Version 1.03
    Jan C. Depner
    01/06/11

    Correct problem with the way I was instantiating the main widget.  This caused an intermittent error on Windows7/XP.


    Version 1.04
    Jan C. Depner
    06/27/11

    Save all directories used by the QFileDialogs.  Add current working directory to the sidebar for all QFileDialogs.


    Version 1.05
    Jan C. Depner
    06/27/11

    Save all directories used by the QFileDialogs.  Add current working directory to the sidebar for all QFileDialogs.


    Version 1.06
    Jan C. Depner
    07/22/11

    Using setSidebarUrls function from nvutility to make sure that current working directory (.) and
    last used directory are in the sidebar URL list of QFileDialogs.

    Jan C. Depner
    11/30/11

    Converted .xpm icons to .png icons.


    Version 1.08
    Jan C. Depner (PFM Software)
    12/09/13

    Switched to using .ini file in $HOME (Linux) or $USERPROFILE (Windows) in the ABE.config directory.  Now
    the applications qsettings will not end up in unknown places like ~/.config/navo.navy.mil/blah_blah_blah on
    Linux or, in the registry (shudder) on Windows.


    Version 1.09
    Jan C. Depner (PFM Software)
    03/08/14

    Replaced using the SRTM land mask with the, MUCH BETTER and public domain, SWBD 1 second mask.


    Version 1.10
    Jan C. Depner (PFM Software)
    07/01/14

    - Replaced all of the old, borrowed icons with new, public domain icons.  Mostly from the Tango set
      but a few from flavour-extended and 32pxmania.


    Version 1.11
    Jan C. Depner (PFM Software)
    07/23/14

    - Switched from using the old NV_INT64 and NV_U_INT32 type definitions to the C99 standard stdint.h and
      inttypes.h sized data types (e.g. int64_t and uint32_t).


    Version 1.12
    Jan C. Depner (PFM Software)
    08/27/16

    - Now uses the same font as all other ABE GUI apps.  Font can only be changed in pfmView Preferences.


    Version 1.13
    Jan C. Depner (PFM Software)
    05/24/19

    - Now uses PFM_USER_10 (PFMv7) instead of PFM_USER_05 (as if anybody is using this program ;-)
